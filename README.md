A copy of Crossy Road, made with Turtle library.

The player starts at the bottom of the screen, "cars" being generated outside the screen on the right side, going to the left with a set speed.

Anytime the player completes a level, the counter from top-left corner increases by 1 and so the speed of the cars.

Whenever a car collides with the player, the game ends.
